I am a fifth year PhD Candidate in Economics and NSF Graduate Research Fellow at Northwestern University. My research is in the fields of Energy and Environmental Economics, Public Economics, and Industrial Organization, focusing on efficiency and equity tradeoffs in energy and environmental policy. 

I will be on the job market during the 2025-2026 academic year.

  <div class="abstract">
    We study optimal design of cash and in-kind progressive reforms to fuel subsidies in a setting with limited information: cash transfers and fuel subsidies in Indonesia. In       2005, the government shifted spending away from a costly and regressive consumer fossil fuel subsidy and towards a targeted cash transfer program, which was hindered by the      government's limited ability to identify low-income households. In our model, a planner with distributional preferences may prefer in-kind over cash mechanisms if the            targeting benefits of self-selection over the in-kind good outweigh the inefficiencies associated with subsidization. We take this model to the data, estimating household        preferences for fuel by exploiting large exogenous shocks to fuel prices, and solving for the optimal policy given a limited government information set. Targeted cash            transfers outperform optimal fuel subsidies in most cases.

  <div class="abstract">
    The US is one of few countries worldwide without a national mandate for paid maternity leave, and as such, we know little about the effects of paid leave in this context. The first cases of statewide maternity leave in the U.S. came about somewhat unintentionally through changes in state Temporary Disability Insurance (TDI) in the 1960s and 1970s. Six to seven decades later, we have the opportunity to explore the long run effects of access to paid maternity leave on children, later in their lives. We do so employing a differences-in-discontinuities design around changes in state TDI policies which made disability insurance available for pregnancy. In "first stage" results, we provide new estimates of the effects of paid maternity leave availability on infant birth weights, improving upon existing methodologies estimating the same effect in the literature, and finding much larger positive effects. In a "second stage" exercise, we will link measures of the education and earnings of children with their birthdate records using Census and Numident data to provide the first estimates of the long run impacts of paid maternity leave on children for the US.
